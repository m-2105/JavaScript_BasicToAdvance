//Topic 02: Variables
"use strict"; //It will forbid you to make mistakes

// Intro to variables -> Variables can store some information, we can use and change this information later

//Declare variable
var firstName = "Muqaddas";
//Print a variable
console.log(firstName);
//Change  value 
firstName = "Alwara";
//Print a variable
console.log(firstName);

// Rules for naming Variables 
//1. You can not start with number -> a.1value❌  b.Value1 ✔
//2. You can use underscore (_) or dollar symbol ($) only -> a.first_name(snake case writing) ✔ b._firstname ✔  c.first$name ✔ d.$firstname ✔
//3. You can not use spaces -> first name ❌
//4. Convention -> Start with a small letter and use camelCase

//Power of a number -> double asterisk (**) calculate the power of a value
var value1 = 2;
console.log(value1 ** 0.5); // 1/2 or 0.5 calculates the square root of a number
